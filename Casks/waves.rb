  # Two macOS flavors from v0.1.16 on (issue #14: the bundled Qt's newer
  # releases require macOS 15): machines on Sequoia and newer get the regular
  # bundle, and Monterey through Sonoma get a legacy bundle built on the last
  # Qt that still runs there. Homebrew picks the block at install time. The
  # release workflow bumps version and all four sha256s; keep the two block
  # openers at this exact two-space indent and the "arm:   " / "intel: "
  # spacing, its seds are anchored to them.
